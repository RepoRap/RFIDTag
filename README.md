# RFIDTag
This form application created for windows system accepts RFID UID input from COM7 of the device. It basically reads the UID of the card or tag and compares it to the values in the sql server. All the SQL credentials would only work when the Srujana laptop SQL connection is turned on so that the data could be compared and transfered.
